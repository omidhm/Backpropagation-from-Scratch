<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of one-hot coded Multi Layer Nueral Network

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* conda
  ```sh
  conda install numpy jupyter
  conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
  ```

### Anaconda prompt

Provide Virtual Environment on devices:
   ```sh
   conda env remove -n ENV_NAME
   conda create -n py python anaconda
   conda install tensorflow-gpu opencv-python jupyter matplotlib tqdm
   conda install -c anaconda cudatoolkit
   conda install tensorflow-gpu opencv-python jupyter matplotlib tqdm numpy 
   ```
 
 
### Weights Updating Rule
   ```sh
      The updating rule for weight is "W ← W + η(d(x) − u(Wx))xT" ; u is the step activation function.
   ```
